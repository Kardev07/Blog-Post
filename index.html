      What are the general programming experiences?
    </h3>
    <p class="first-para">
      Programming is an unsolvable mystery for a lot of people. They start to
      learn Programming to become Experienced and Respected Devlopers.<br />
      And I have to accept I had the same fate as others when it came to
      Programming experience for the first time. I set out my journey just like
      others... <br />
      I set out in eerie mist of the vast Programming Opportunities available. I
      had no idea what was in the store for me and I was going to face it.

    <h3 class="second-para-heading">How I took up programming</h3>
    <p class="second-para">
      To start off, I used to hate programming at one point of time. But during
      the covid 19 pandemic, I decided to start learning programming just for
      fun <br />
    </p>

    <h3 class="third-para-heading">
      Which programming language did I learn first?
    </h3>
    <p class="third-para">
      To be honest, I learnt the Python programming language. It was really
      simple and easy to understand when it came to other languages.<br />
      And if you are a beginner, I would recommend learning a simple and easy
      language to understand. Otherwise, you might be stuck at the hands of a
      language which can be really confusing for you.<br />

    <h3 class="fourth-para-heading">
      Which programming language do I learn first?
    </h3>
    <p class="fourth-para">
      Actually there are a lot of programming languages to learn as a beginner.
      But you should learn the language which can be used to make the stuff you
      are most interested in. <br />
      The python programming language has many applications in which yours might
      be one. But there are some other languages which you might be interested
      in. <br />
      Some of the easy, simple languages to learn as a beginner are C# .NET,
      Html and CSS and Python <br />
